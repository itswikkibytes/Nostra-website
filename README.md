Nostra – My Latest Front-End Project!

!👋
I’m excited to share Nostra, a fully responsive and clean website I built from scratch using:

🧱 HTML5
🎨 CSS3
⚡ Tailwind CSS
🧠 JavaScript

The goal? To create a smooth and seamless user experience across all screen sizes — from mobile phones 📱 to desktops 💻 — while adding dynamic features like:

🔍 Live product filtering using search input
☑ Checkbox-based filters for categories

💡 What I learned & practiced:

📐 Tailwind’s grid & flex layout system
🧼 Writing clean, modular, and scalable code
🔧 DOM manipulation for interactivity
📱 Responsive, mobile-first design techniques
🎯 Creating a functional & aesthetic UI
